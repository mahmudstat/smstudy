## Day 01

### Set 01

Desiccated, Proselytize, Pellucid, Gumption, Bridle

### Text 01

Once a vibrant speaker brimming with **gumption**, the philosopher's recent lectures have become **desiccated**, drained of the vitality that once drew crowds. Though his ideas remain **pellucid**—remarkably clear and logically coherent—his tendency to **proselytize** rather than persuade has begun to alienate his audience. Many now **bridle** at his dogmatic tone, feeling more lectured at than engaged, as if intellectual dialogue had given way to moral sermonizing.

### Set 02

Unimpeachable,Enormity, Self-effacing, Coterminous, Elegiac

### Text 02

The professor, known for his *unimpeachable* reputation and *self-effacing* demeanor, delivered a lecture that was both *elegiac* in tone and intellectually invigorating. Reflecting on the *enormity* of historical tragedies, he reminded the audience that academic inquiry and moral responsibility are often *coterminous*—sharing boundaries in both scope and purpose. Though his insights were profound, he never sought praise, preferring instead to highlight the contributions of others, a trait that only deepened respect for his *unimpeachable* character.

### Set 03

Conflagration, Unassailable, Impervious, Appropriate, Malingerer

### Text 03

What began as a minor policy dispute soon escalated into a political **conflagration**, engulfing the entire administration in controversy. While some officials scrambled to distance themselves, the press secretary maintained an **unassailable** calm, her statements **impervious** to critique and scrutiny. Meanwhile, critics accused certain members of the cabinet of attempting to **appropriate** the moral high ground, despite their complicit silence during the scandal’s early days. One particularly vocal detractor went so far as to brand the deputy minister a **malingerer**, suggesting he had feigned illness to avoid public accountability during the height of the crisis.

### Set 04

Stultify, Internecine, Hauteur, Panegyric, Pontificate

### Text 04

The boardroom debate, meant to foster collaboration, quickly devolved into an **internecine** clash of egos, with factions tearing into each other's proposals more out of pride than principle. At the center of the conflict stood the CEO, whose **hauteur** alienated even his allies. Rather than mediating, he chose to **pontificate** at length about leadership and vision, offering platitudes instead of solutions. His speech, which he likely envisioned as a **panegyric** to his own legacy, did little to inspire confidence. On the contrary, it served to **stultify** innovation, creating an atmosphere where fresh ideas withered under the weight of condescension and inertia.


### Set 05

Transmute, Proscribe, Turgid, Dolorous, Solicitous

### Text 05

Despite the artist’s attempt to **transmute** personal grief into something universally resonant, the result was a **turgid** display of self-indulgent melancholy that left critics unimpressed. The exhibition, laden with overwrought symbolism and meandering monologues, was intended to evoke empathy, but instead it alienated its audience. Even the most **solicitous** observers, eager to appreciate the emotional vulnerability on display, found themselves struggling to connect with the work’s **dolorous** tone and lack of clarity. Some cultural commentators went as far as to **proscribe** such artistic expressions, arguing that unfiltered emotional catharsis should not masquerade as profound art.
