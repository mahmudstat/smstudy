### Set 01

**[Desiccated](## "Thoroughly dried out; lacking moisture"), [Proselytize](## "To attempt to convert someone to a particular belief or faith"), [Pellucid](## "Clear, transparent, or easily understood"), [Gumption](## "Courage, initiative, or resourcefulness"), [Bridle](## "To restrain or control, especially in a way that limits freedom")**

Once a vibrant speaker brimming with **gumption**, the philosopher's recent lectures have become **desiccated**, drained of the vitality that once drew crowds. Though his ideas remain **pellucid**—remarkably clear and logically coherent—his tendency to **proselytize** rather than persuade has begun to alienate his audience. Many now **bridle** at his dogmatic tone, feeling more lectured at than engaged, as if intellectual dialogue had given way to moral sermonizing.

### Set 02

**[Unimpeachable](## "Unable to be doubted, criticized, or questioned; flawless"), [Enormity](## "The great seriousness or scale of something, especially a problem or crime"), [Self-effacing](## "Modest or humble, not seeking attention for oneself"), [Coterminous](## "Having the same boundaries or extent in time or space"), [Elegiac](## "Expressing sorrow or mourning, often in a poetic manner")**

The professor, known for his *unimpeachable* reputation and *self-effacing* demeanor, delivered a lecture that was both *elegiac* in tone and intellectually invigorating. Reflecting on the *enormity* of historical tragedies, he reminded the audience that academic inquiry and moral responsibility are often *coterminous*—sharing boundaries in both scope and purpose. Though his insights were profound, he never sought praise, preferring instead to highlight the contributions of others, a trait that only deepened respect for his *unimpeachable* character.

### Set 03

**[Conflagration](## "A large destructive fire, often one that spreads quickly"), [Unassailable](## "Unable to be attacked, questioned, or defeated"), [Impervious](## "Not allowing something to pass through or be affected by"), [Appropriate](## "To take something for one's own use, often without permission; suitable or fitting for a particular situation"), [Malingerer](## "A person who pretends to be ill or incapacitated to avoid work or duty")**

What began as a minor policy dispute soon escalated into a political **conflagration**, engulfing the entire administration in controversy. While some officials scrambled to distance themselves, the press secretary maintained an **unassailable** calm, her statements **impervious** to critique and scrutiny. Meanwhile, critics accused certain members of the cabinet of attempting to **appropriate** the moral high ground, despite their complicit silence during the scandal’s early days. One particularly vocal detractor went so far as to brand the deputy minister a **malingerer**, suggesting he had feigned illness to avoid public accountability during the height of the crisis.

### Set 04

**[Stultify](## "To make someone or something appear foolish or to cause to lose enthusiasm or vitality"), [Internecine](## "Destructive to both sides in a conflict; mutually harmful"), [Hauteur](## "Arrogance or pride, often expressed in a condescending manner"), [Panegyric](## "A speech or piece of writing that praises someone or something highly"), [Pontificate](## "To speak in a pompous or authoritative manner, often without considering others' opinions")**

The boardroom debate, meant to foster collaboration, quickly devolved into an **internecine** clash of egos, with factions tearing into each other's proposals more out of pride than principle. At the center of the conflict stood the CEO, whose **hauteur** alienated even his allies. Rather than mediating, he chose to **pontificate** at length about leadership and vision, offering platitudes instead of solutions. His speech, which he likely envisioned as a **panegyric** to his own legacy, did little to inspire confidence. On the contrary, it served to **stultify** innovation, creating an atmosphere where fresh ideas withered under the weight of condescension and inertia.


### Set 05

**[Transmute](## "To change or transform in form, nature, or substance"), [Proscribe](## "To forbid or prohibit, especially by law or authority"), [Turgid](## "Swollen, inflated, or pompous, often used to describe language or writing"), [Dolorous](## "Expressing sorrow or grief; mournful"), [Solicitous](## "Showing concern or care for someone's well-being")**

Despite the artist’s attempt to **transmute** personal grief into something universally resonant, the result was a **turgid** display of self-indulgent melancholy that left critics unimpressed. The exhibition, laden with overwrought symbolism and meandering monologues, was intended to evoke empathy, but instead it alienated its audience. Even the most **solicitous** observers, eager to appreciate the emotional vulnerability on display, found themselves struggling to connect with the work’s **dolorous** tone and lack of clarity. Some cultural commentators went as far as to **proscribe** such artistic expressions, arguing that unfiltered emotional catharsis should not masquerade as profound art.

## Day 02

### Set 01

**[Complaisant](## "Willing to please others; obliging or courteous"), [Mendicant](## "A person who lives by begging or depending on charity"), [Impugn](## "To challenge or attack the truth, integrity, or validity of something"), [Conflate](## "To combine two or more things into one, often inaccurately"), [Obtuse](## "Dull or slow to understand; lacking sharpness or quickness of mind")**

The senator’s **complaisant** aides, always eager to please, rarely challenged his decisions—even when they clearly led to public backlash. In contrast, a lone journalist, once dismissed as a mere **mendicant** for truth, tirelessly investigated the campaign’s finances. When she began to publicly **impugn** the integrity of certain donations, accusing the team of impropriety, the senator deflected, accusing her of trying to **conflate** minor oversights with deliberate fraud. Yet his most **obtuse** move was underestimating the intelligence of the electorate, who saw through the vague defenses and demanded transparency.

### Set 02

**[Vaunted](## "Boasted about or praised excessively, often in an exaggerated manner"), [Palatable](## "Pleasant or acceptable to the taste or mind"), [Tyro](## "A beginner or novice in a particular field or activity"), [Afford](## "To have the financial means to do or buy something; to provide or supply"), [Abjure](## "To renounce or give up something formally, especially a belief or cause")**

The startup's **vaunted** technology, hailed as revolutionary in press releases, turned out to be far less impressive when scrutinized by experts. While the concept was **palatable** to investors—appealing enough to secure funding—it lacked practical application. The lead engineer, a **tyro** fresh out of graduate school, had enthusiasm but little real-world experience. The design, though ambitious, failed to **afford** any real advantage over existing solutions. Eventually, the company was forced to **abjure** its bold claims and revise its goals, publicly distancing itself from its earlier hyperbole.

### Set 03

**[Sardonic](## "Mocking or cynical, often in a scornful manner"), [Oblique](## "Not explicit or straightforward; indirect"), [Canard](## "A false or misleading story or rumor"), [Bereft](## "Deprived of something, especially a loved one or a quality"), [Exiguity](## "The state of being very small or cramped; scarcity or smallness")**

When the documentary on ancient exploration aired, viewers were struck by the narrator’s **sardonic** humor—his dry, almost mocking remarks added unexpected levity to the subject. One segment explored an old **canard** about a lost civilization supposedly buried beneath the ocean, a story long since debunked but still retold with fascination. The archaeologist interviewed gave an **oblique** answer when asked about his belief in the legend, hinting at possibilities without ever stating his view directly. The ruins themselves, **bereft** of any inscriptions or artifacts, offered little to support the myth. The team’s biggest challenge, however, was the **exiguity** of light in the cave—just enough to see, but not enough to photograph anything clearly.
