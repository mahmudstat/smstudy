    "text": "1.1.1 Set 01\nDesiccated, Proselytize, Pellucid, Gumption, Bridle\nOnce a vibrant speaker brimming with gumption, the philosopher’s recent lectures have become desiccated, drained of the vitality that once drew crowds. Though his ideas remain pellucid—remarkably clear and logically coherent—his tendency to proselytize rather than persuade has begun to alienate his audience. Many now bridle at his dogmatic tone, feeling more lectured at than engaged, as if intellectual dialogue had given way to moral sermonizing.\n\n\n1.1.2 Set 02\nUnimpeachable,Enormity, Self-effacing, Coterminous, Elegiac\nThe professor, known for his unimpeachable reputation and self-effacing demeanor, delivered a lecture that was both elegiac in tone and intellectually invigorating. Reflecting on the enormity of historical tragedies, he reminded the audience that academic inquiry and moral responsibility are often coterminous—sharing boundaries in both scope and purpose. Though his insights were profound, he never sought praise, preferring instead to highlight the contributions of others, a trait that only deepened respect for his unimpeachable character.\n\n\n1.1.3 Set 03\nConflagration, Unassailable, Impervious, Appropriate, Malingerer\nWhat began as a minor policy dispute soon escalated into a political conflagration, engulfing the entire administration in controversy. While some officials scrambled to distance themselves, the press secretary maintained an unassailable calm, her statements impervious to critique and scrutiny. Meanwhile, critics accused certain members of the cabinet of attempting to appropriate the moral high ground, despite their complicit silence during the scandal’s early days. One particularly vocal detractor went so far as to brand the deputy minister a malingerer, suggesting he had feigned illness to avoid public accountability during the height of the crisis.\n\n\n1.1.4 Set 04\nStultify, Internecine, Hauteur, Panegyric, Pontificate\nThe boardroom debate, meant to foster collaboration, quickly devolved into an internecine clash of egos, with factions tearing into each other’s proposals more out of pride than principle. At the center of the conflict stood the CEO, whose hauteur alienated even his allies. Rather than mediating, he chose to pontificate at length about leadership and vision, offering platitudes instead of solutions. His speech, which he likely envisioned as a panegyric to his own legacy, did little to inspire confidence. On the contrary, it served to stultify innovation, creating an atmosphere where fresh ideas withered under the weight of condescension and inertia.\n\n\n1.1.5 Set 05\nTransmute, Proscribe, Turgid, Dolorous, Solicitous\nDespite the artist’s attempt to transmute personal grief into something universally resonant, the result was a turgid display of self-indulgent melancholy that left critics unimpressed. The exhibition, laden with overwrought symbolism and meandering monologues, was intended to evoke empathy, but instead it alienated its audience. Even the most solicitous observers, eager to appreciate the emotional vulnerability on display, found themselves struggling to connect with the work’s dolorous tone and lack of clarity. Some cultural commentators went as far as to proscribe such artistic expressions, arguing that unfiltered emotional catharsis should not masquerade as profound art.",
