    "text": "1.1.1 Set 01\nDesiccated, Proselytize, Pellucid, Gumption, Bridle\nOnce a vibrant speaker brimming with gumption, the philosopher’s recent lectures have become desiccated, drained of the vitality that once drew crowds. Though his ideas remain pellucid—remarkably clear and logically coherent—his tendency to proselytize rather than persuade has begun to alienate his audience. Many now bridle at his dogmatic tone, feeling more lectured at than engaged, as if intellectual dialogue had given way to moral sermonizing.\n\n\n1.1.2 Set 02\nUnimpeachable, Enormity, Self-effacing, Coterminous, Elegiac\nThe professor, known for his unimpeachable reputation and self-effacing demeanor, delivered a lecture that was both elegiac in tone and intellectually invigorating. Reflecting on the enormity of historical tragedies, he reminded the audience that academic inquiry and moral responsibility are often coterminous—sharing boundaries in both scope and purpose. Though his insights were profound, he never sought praise, preferring instead to highlight the contributions of others, a trait that only deepened respect for his unimpeachable character.\n\n\n1.1.3 Set 03\nConflagration, Unassailable, Impervious, Appropriate, Malingerer\nWhat began as a minor policy dispute soon escalated into a political conflagration, engulfing the entire administration in controversy. While some officials scrambled to distance themselves, the press secretary maintained an unassailable calm, her statements impervious to critique and scrutiny. Meanwhile, critics accused certain members of the cabinet of attempting to appropriate the moral high ground, despite their complicit silence during the scandal’s early days. One particularly vocal detractor went so far as to brand the deputy minister a malingerer, suggesting he had feigned illness to avoid public accountability during the height of the crisis.\n\n\n1.1.4 Set 04\nStultify, Internecine, Hauteur, Panegyric, Pontificate\nThe boardroom debate, meant to foster collaboration, quickly devolved into an internecine clash of egos, with factions tearing into each other’s proposals more out of pride than principle. At the center of the conflict stood the CEO, whose hauteur alienated even his allies. Rather than mediating, he chose to pontificate at length about leadership and vision, offering platitudes instead of solutions. His speech, which he likely envisioned as a panegyric to his own legacy, did little to inspire confidence. On the contrary, it served to stultify innovation, creating an atmosphere where fresh ideas withered under the weight of condescension and inertia.\n\n\n1.1.5 Set 05\nTransmute, Proscribe, Turgid, Dolorous, Solicitous\nDespite the artist’s attempt to transmute personal grief into something universally resonant, the result was a turgid display of self-indulgent melancholy that left critics unimpressed. The exhibition, laden with overwrought symbolism and meandering monologues, was intended to evoke empathy, but instead it alienated its audience. Even the most solicitous observers, eager to appreciate the emotional vulnerability on display, found themselves struggling to connect with the work’s dolorous tone and lack of clarity. Some cultural commentators went as far as to proscribe such artistic expressions, arguing that unfiltered emotional catharsis should not masquerade as profound art.",

    "text": "1.2 Day 02\n\n1.2.1 Set 01\nComplaisant, Mendicant, Impugn, Conflate, Obtuse\nThe senator’s complaisant aides, always eager to please, rarely challenged his decisions—even when they clearly led to public backlash. In contrast, a lone journalist, once dismissed as a mere mendicant for truth, tirelessly investigated the campaign’s finances. When she began to publicly impugn the integrity of certain donations, accusing the team of impropriety, the senator deflected, accusing her of trying to conflate minor oversights with deliberate fraud. Yet his most obtuse move was underestimating the intelligence of the electorate, who saw through the vague defenses and demanded transparency.\n\n\n1.2.2 Set 02\nVaunted, Palatable, Tyro, Afford, Abjure\nThe startup’s vaunted technology, hailed as revolutionary in press releases, turned out to be far less impressive when scrutinized by experts. While the concept was palatable to investors—appealing enough to secure funding—it lacked practical application. The lead engineer, a tyro fresh out of graduate school, had enthusiasm but little real-world experience. The design, though ambitious, failed to afford any real advantage over existing solutions. Eventually, the company was forced to abjure its bold claims and revise its goals, publicly distancing itself from its earlier hyperbole.\n\n\n1.2.3 Set 03\nSardonic, Oblique, Canard, Bereft, Exiguity\nWhen the documentary on ancient exploration aired, viewers were struck by the narrator’s sardonic humor—his dry, almost mocking remarks added unexpected levity to the subject. One segment explored an old canard about a lost civilization supposedly buried beneath the ocean, a story long since debunked but still retold with fascination. The archaeologist interviewed gave an oblique answer when asked about his belief in the legend, hinting at possibilities without ever stating his view directly. The ruins themselves, bereft of any inscriptions or artifacts, offered little to support the myth. The team’s biggest challenge, however, was the exiguity of light in the cave—just enough to see, but not enough to photograph anything clearly.\nTest Sardonic",
