## The Shift

“Morning, Rafiq,” said Yusuf, tipping his cap. “Paper’s late again.”

Rafiq smirked. “Late? It’s always late. You ever notice that?”

Yusuf shrugged. “Time’s a **capricious** thing, friend.”

Their exchange was casual, **banal**, almost **perfunctory**, but something in Yusuf’s phrasing gave Rafiq pause. Time wasn’t just capricious—it was consistent to the point of **monotony**.

He made his way to the archive building, where he worked cataloging old records. The place smelled like old wood and carbon, the kind of environment he found **salutary** for thinking.

At his desk, he opened the logbook and began entering dates from the files. September 14, 2041. September 14, 2041. September 14—again.

He flipped through twenty folders. All marked the same date. He frowned.

“This can’t be right.”

He approached his colleague, Imran, a taciturn man who prided himself on precision.

“Imran, look at this. Every document I touched today has the same date.”

Imran took the folders with **affectation**, leafing through them slowly. “System error. Ignore it.”

“But they’re physical copies.”

Imran raised an eyebrow, his tone almost **didactic**. “Rafiq, don't get **inundated** by anomalies. Just keep working.”

That night, Rafiq couldn’t sleep. His mind was a churn of irregularities. The archives, the rigid schedules, the way Yusuf always said the exact same three phrases in the same order each morning. He scribbled a flowchart, tracking events, reactions, phrases. Patterns emerged—**disquieting** ones.

A week later, he went to the outskirts of the city. He wasn’t sure why—only that something was pulling him.

There, among the transmission towers, he found a utility door marked “AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.” It was slightly ajar. No one in the city ever left doors open.

Inside, fluorescent lights flickered, illuminating a narrow corridor filled with humming servers and tangled wires. A man in a gray coat sat hunched over a terminal.

“You’re not supposed to be here,” the man said without turning.

Rafiq stepped closer. “Who are you?”

The man finally faced him. His expression was **phlegmatic**, his voice cold. “I’m part of the maintenance team. This is a control node.”

“For what?”

The man stared. “Everything.”

There was a silence so **pregnant** with tension that Rafiq’s breath caught in his throat.

“You mean—”

“Yes. Simulated. Engineered. You were part of a psychological resilience study. You opted in voluntarily.”

Rafiq’s pulse quickened. “Then why don’t I remember?”

“You opted for a **mnemonic wipe** for authenticity. But the simulation is degrading. You’re starting to see through it.”

Rafiq backed away. “No. This isn’t possible. I know this place. I know people.”

“You know scripts,” the man corrected. “Yusuf? A conversational loop. Imran? Data gatekeeper. Their vocabularies are limited by design.”

Rafiq clenched his fists. “Then let me out.”

The man hesitated. “The exit protocol is **arduous**. Painful. But irreversible.”

“I don’t care. I want truth, not this—**facade**.”

The next thing he saw was light. Real light. Not the programmable ambiance of the simulation.

He was lying in a pod. Tubes in his arms. A technician nearby dropped his clipboard in shock.

“Subject 447 has reawakened!”

Rafiq blinked at the sterile white ceiling. He felt weak, **enervated**, but alive.

They told him it had been twelve years. That the world he remembered was one of thousands—iterations of a controlled environment.

Now, the air felt colder, the walls less polished, but every imperfection was a reassurance.

The simulation had been flawless. But it lacked one thing:

**Entropy.**

And that, more than anything, made the real world sublime.
