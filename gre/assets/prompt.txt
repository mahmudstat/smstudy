There are 1046 words in the csv (gre_words.csv), where the columns are word, definition. We'll create a javascript based flashcard with each 10 words. So first card: 1-10 words, 2nd: 11-20 etc. the last 1041-1056 (6 only), totalling 105 cards.

The page (.qmd) will be a part of a quarto website (rendered on terminal)

On top of the page user can select from dropdown Flashcard 1,2,..105.

gre-flashcards.qmd file will contain the code to fetch contents from the csv as per dropdown click. The card will have 4 options. The correct option will be taken from the definition column. other options will be taken randomly from other definitions.

After user clicks each word, the score as well as which is correct/wrong will be shown.
