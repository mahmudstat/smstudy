## Segment 01

### Passage 01

The speaker’s attempt to <a id="Embellish" href="gre-word-list.html#Embellish">**embellish**</a> the facts only served to confuse the audience, as he began to <a id="Meander" href="gre-word-list.html#Meander">**meander**</a> through irrelevant anecdotes. In contrast, his opponent’s argument was both <a id="Cerebral" href="gre-word-list.html#Cerebral">**cerebral**</a> and <a id="Cogent" href="gre-word-list.html#Cogent">**cogent**</a>, supported by data and a clear logical structure. The most compelling <a id="Corollary" href="gre-word-list.html#Corollary">**corollary**</a> to her reasoning was that effective policies must remain <a id="Steadfast" href="gre-word-list.html#Steadfast">**steadfast**</a> even in the face of political turbulence. Her <a id="Dispassionate" href="gre-word-list.html#Dispassionate">**dispassionate**</a> tone contrasted sharply with his tendency to <a id="Belittle" href="gre-word-list.html#Belittle">**belittle**</a> opposing views. In a move to <a id="Preempt" href="gre-word-list.html#Preempt">**preempt**</a> criticism, she addressed the weaknesses in her proposal openly, avoiding the kind of <a id="Duplicity" href="gre-word-list.html#Duplicity">**duplicity**</a> that had undermined earlier debates.

### Passage 02

The museum’s new exhibit, curated by a renowned <a id="Aesthete" href="gre-word-list.html#Aesthete">**aesthete**</a>, was a <a id="Cohesive" href="gre-word-list.html#Cohesive">**cohesive**</a> blend of classical elegance and modern flair. While most attendees were <a id="Genteel" href="gre-word-list.html#Genteel">**genteel**</a> in their praise, one critic offered a <a id="Sardonic" href="gre-word-list.html#Sardonic">**sardonic**</a> take, calling the fusion “a tasteful train wreck.” Reactions were largely <a id="Contingent" href="gre-word-list.html#Contingent">**contingent**</a> on personal taste, but the artist, known for her <a id="Whimsical" href="gre-word-list.html#Whimsical">**whimsical**</a> style, remained unfazed. The choice to feature an <a id="Anomalous" href="gre-word-list.html#Anomalous">**anomalous**</a> piece—a digital sculpture made entirely of sound—was seen by some as an <a id="Aberration" href="gre-word-list.html#Aberration">**aberration**</a>. Yet, for others, it captured the very <a id="Imponderable" href="gre-word-list.html#Imponderable">**imponderable**</a> nature of art itself.


### Passage 03

As the storm grew more <a id="Inclement" href="gre-word-list.html#Inclement">**inclement**</a>, officials moved quickly to <a id="Avert" href="gre-word-list.html#Avert">**avert**</a> disaster by evacuating the area. The mayor, usually <a id="Expansive" href="gre-word-list.html#Expansive">**expansive**</a> in demeanor, grew solemn, eventually forced to <a id="Concede" href="gre-word-list.html#Concede">**concede**</a> that their preparations had fallen short. Citizens, <a id="Bereft" href="gre-word-list.html#Bereft">**bereft**</a> of shelter and supplies, began to <a id="Besiege" href="gre-word-list.html#Besiege">**besiege**</a> local aid centers. Critics did not hesitate to <a id="Censure" href="gre-word-list.html#Censure">**censure**</a> the administration for the glaring <a id="Inequity" href="gre-word-list.html#Inequity">**inequity**</a> in resource distribution. News outlets sought to <a id="Delineate" href="gre-word-list.html#Delineate">**delineate**</a> the chain of failures that had led to this crisis, particularly the neglect of vulnerable neighborhoods—areas many accused the government of having <a id="Desecrate" href="gre-word-list.html#Desecrate">**desecrated**</a> through years of policy indifference.

### Passage 04

His career had finally reached its <a id="Summit" href="gre-word-list.html#Summit">**summit**</a>, a pinnacle of achievement few in his field could rival. But success did not make him complacent. While others might indulge, he maintained a <a id="Spartan" href="gre-word-list.html#Spartan">**spartan**</a> lifestyle, eschewing luxury for discipline. A sudden scandal emerged, yet he remained untouched, his character long considered <a id="Unimpeachable" href="gre-word-list.html#Unimpeachable">**unimpeachable**</a>. In the face of public frenzy, where commentators <a id="Maunder" href="gre-word-list.html#Maunder">**maundered**</a> endlessly with little substance, he took quiet but firm action. Though the crisis was an <a id="Anomaly" href="gre-word-list.html#Anomaly">**anomaly**</a> in an otherwise smooth trajectory, his <a id="Resolve" href="gre-word-list.html#Resolve">**resolve**</a> never faltered. He worked to <a id="Foment" href="gre-word-list.html#Foment">**foment**</a> meaningful change rather than retaliation, an <a id="Estimable" href="gre-word-list.html#Estimable">**estimable**</a> quality that drew admiration—even from opponents. In contrast, his rival’s <a id="Forlorn" href="gre-word-list.html#Forlorn">**forlorn**</a> efforts to stir a <a id="Melee" href="gre-word-list.html#Melee">**melee**</a> of public opinion quickly fizzled, lacking the gravity or grace to match him.

## Segment 02

### Passage 01

She tried to <a id="Equivocate" href="gre-word-list.html#Equivocate">**equivocate**</a> during the interview, dodging questions about her controversial report, but the panel wasn’t fooled. The once <a id="Effervescent" href="gre-word-list.html#Effervescent">**effervescent**</a> scientist now appeared <a id="Morose" href="gre-word-list.html#Morose">**morose**</a>, her energy drained by months of criticism. The backlash had been <a id="Excruciating" href="gre-word-list.html#Excruciating">**excruciating**</a>, amplified by the media’s relentless desire to <a id="Pillory" href="gre-word-list.html#Pillory">**pillory**</a> anyone who defied consensus. Attempts to <a id="Squelch" href="gre-word-list.html#Squelch">**squelch**</a> the uproar had failed, and even her supporters grew <a id="Disheartened" href="gre-word-list.html#Disheartened">**disheartened**</a>. What was most <a id="Poignant" href="gre-word-list.html#Poignant">**poignant**</a> was the contrast between her current state and her past brilliance—when she made <a id="Prodigious" href="gre-word-list.html#Prodigious">**prodigious**</a> discoveries and carried herself with inspiring confidence. But over time, her once-bold stance softened into a <a id="Complacent" href="gre-word-list.html#Complacent">**complacent**</a> silence, worn down by a system that punished dissent.

### Passage 02

Launched in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope marked a revolutionary shift in astronomy, offering a level of detail previously thought unattainable. Despite initial setbacks—including an <a id="Anemic" href="gre-word-list.html#Anemic">**anemic**</a> start due to a flawed mirror—subsequent repairs transformed it into one of science’s most <a id="Estimable" href="gre-word-list.html#Estimable">**estimable**</a> tools. The <a id="Fete" href="gre-word-list.html#Fete">**fete**</a> surrounding its discoveries was well-deserved, from capturing distant galaxies to providing data that challenged cosmic expansion theories. Though occasionally <a id="Disheartened" href="gre-word-list.html#Disheartened">**disheartened**</a> by delays and budget cuts, the scientific community remained steadfast, recognizing that even minor discoveries could <a id="Recrudesce" href="gre-word-list.html#Recrudesce">**recrudesce**</a> dormant questions about our universe’s origins.

### Passage 03

In the field of geography, a <a id="Tyro" href="gre-word-list.html#Tyro">**tyro**</a> may initially struggle with the complexities of spatial data and climate modeling, often overwhelmed by the depth of knowledge required. However, with time and guidance, even the most <a id="Inarticulate" href="gre-word-list.html#Inarticulate">**inarticulate**</a> students can develop the necessary skills, becoming more <a id="Savvy" href="gre-word-list.html#Savvy">**savvy**</a> in interpreting maps and understanding ecological patterns. A <a id="Rapprochement" href="gre-word-list.html#Rapprochement">**rapprochement**</a> between theory and practice is often seen as students <a id="Dovetail" href="gre-word-list.html#Dovetail">**dovetail**</a> their learning experiences with real-world applications. Though early lessons can sometimes feel <a id="Soporific" href="gre-word-list.html#Soporific">**soporific**</a>, the <a id="Candidness" href="gre-word-list.html#Candidness">**candidness**</a> of the instruction often makes students appreciate the importance of foundational knowledge, helping them avoid a <a id="Jejune" href="gre-word-list.html#Jejune">**jejune**</a> understanding of the subject. It's not uncommon for a <a id="Flippant" href="gre-word-list.html#Flippant">**flippant**</a> attitude to emerge among beginners, but with time, this is replaced by more <a id="Approbatory" href="gre-word-list.html#Approbatory">**approbatory**</a> recognition of the discipline's significance.

### Passage 04

The Eiffel Tower, an iconic structure in Paris, is a <a id="Conspicuous" href="gre-word-list.html#Conspicuous">**conspicuous**</a> symbol of French ingenuity and engineering prowess, towering over the city. However, its original reception was less than <a id="Amiable" href="gre-word-list.html#Amiable">**amiable**</a>, with many critics <a id="Confound" href="gre-word-list.html#Confound">**confounding**</a> its design with disdain, calling it an eyesore. Despite these critiques, the tower has become so synonymous with Paris that it’s nearly impossible to <a id="Differentiate" href="gre-word-list.html#Differentiate">**differentiate**</a> the city from the monument itself. In its early years, some even considered the structure an <a id="Apostate" href="gre-word-list.html#Apostate">**apostate**</a> against traditional French architecture, marking a departure from classical styles. Yet, through the years, it has emerged as a <a id="Sedulous" href="gre-word-list.html#Sedulous">**sedulous**</a> testament to progress, overcoming early disparagements. Like a <a id="Hound" href="gre-word-list.html#Hound">**hound**</a> relentlessly pursuing its goal, the Eiffel Tower rose to prominence, its critics unable to <a id="Arrogate" href="gre-word-list.html#Arrogate">**arrogate**</a> its position as a cultural landmark. Today, it stands as a symbol of both <a id="Martial" href="gre-word-list.html#Martial">**martial**</a> precision and artistic elegance, despite being built during an era when many regarded it as an <a id="Errant" href="gre-word-list.html#Errant">**arrant**</a> folly. Yet, its towering presence is anything but <a id="Phlegmatic" href="gre-word-list.html#Phlegmatic">**phlegmatic**</a>, as it continues to inspire awe in visitors from around the world.

## Segment 03

### Passage 01

The Amazon Rainforest, often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth," is a vast and diverse ecosystem that spans across nine countries in South America. Its ecological importance is <a id="Impregnable" href="gre-word-list.html#Impregnable">**impregnable**</a>, playing a crucial role in regulating the global climate by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide. However, human activity, such as deforestation, continues to <a id="Exasperate" href="gre-word-list.html#Exasperate">**exasperate**</a> conservation efforts, as the forest’s delicate balance is being disrupted. To <a id="Disabuse" href="gre-word-list.html#Disabuse">**disabuse**</a> those who think that the Amazon is invulnerable, it is important to note that its survival is increasingly under threat. While some <a id="Espouse" href="gre-word-list.html#Espouse">**espouse**</a> the idea of economic development over environmental concerns, many environmentalists argue that the future of the Earth hinges on preserving this irreplaceable resource. The Amazon also has a <a id="Forthcoming" href="gre-word-list.html#Forthcoming">**forthcoming**</a> role in scientific discoveries, with ongoing research revealing new species and medicinal plants. Despite challenges, the Amazon remains a <a id="Thoroughgoing" href="gre-word-list.html#Thoroughgoing">**thoroughgoing**</a> testament to the Earth’s natural beauty and resilience, and efforts to protect it have been gaining momentum globally. The region's indigenous peoples, although <a id="Diffident" href="gre-word-list.html#Diffident">**diffident**</a> about outsiders, have long been protectors of the forest, offering valuable knowledge on sustainable living. As the world faces environmental crises, the Amazon serves as a <a id="Audacious" href="gre-word-list.html#Audacious">**audacious**</a> reminder of nature's grandeur and fragility. The devastation of parts of the forest would <a id="Stultify" href="gre-word-list.html#Stultify">**stultify**</a> any efforts to combat climate change. The increasing power of multinational corporations, sometimes acting as a <a id="Junta" href="gre-word-list.html#Junta">**junta**</a> in their impact on the region, poses a serious threat to the rainforest's survival. Preserving the Amazon is nothing short of an <a id="Apotheosis" href="gre-word-list.html#Apotheosis">**apotheosis**</a> of global environmental efforts.

### Passage 02

The journey of exploring new cultures can often be filled with both joy and <a id="Tribulation" href="gre-word-list.html#Tribulation">**tribulation**</a>. While the rewards of travel can be immense, travelers must also <a id="Abrogate" href="gre-word-list.html#Abrogate">**abrogate**</a> some of their preconceived notions and habits. In certain parts of the world, people may have a <a id="Rakish" href="gre-word-list.html#Rakish">**rakish**</a> appearance, with a confident air that might come off as <a id="Hauteur" href="gre-word-list.html#Hauteur">**hauteur**</a> to those unfamiliar with the culture. Still, if one can <a id="Dispatch" href="gre-word-list.html#Dispatch">**dispatch**</a> any fears quickly, the experience will be enriching. However, <a id="Hamper" href="gre-word-list.html#Hamper">**hamper**</a>ing circumstances such as language barriers or unfamiliar environments can sometimes make the journey <a id="Languid" href="gre-word-list.html#Languid">**languid**</a> and tiresome. Still, the effort is often worth it. As one becomes more accustomed, they might <a id="Bristle" href="gre-word-list.html#Bristle">**bristle**</a> at the notion of having to revert to their old, comfortable ways. Some interactions, however, can have <a id="Invidious" href="gre-word-list.html#Invidious">**invidious**</a> qualities, with undercurrents of jealousy or competition. Fortunately, many people remain <a id="Guileless" href="gre-word-list.html#Guileless">**guileless**</a>, welcoming others with genuine warmth. The <a id="Intimate" href="gre-word-list.html#Intimate">**intimate**</a> connections forged in such environments often begin with subtle <a id="Intimation" href="gre-word-list.html#Intimation">**intimations**</a> of shared understanding.

### Passage 03

In the small town, the <a id="Demean" href="gre-word-list.html#Demean">**demean**</a>ing behavior of the local leader became a topic of much <a id="Reproach" href="gre-word-list.html#Reproach">**reproach**</a>, as many felt that he had fallen from the <a id="Pinnacle" href="gre-word-list.html#Pinnacle">**pinnacle**</a> of integrity. His actions seemed to <a id="Galvanize" href="gre-word-list.html#Galvanize">**galvanize**</a> the community, pushing them to take action and demand change. A once <a id="Derelict" href="gre-word-list.html#Derelict">**derelict**</a> and uninvolved group of citizens were now full of energy and purpose, though they were also <a id="Unnerve" href="gre-word-list.html#Unnerve">**unnerve**</a>d by the unrest that had taken root. Some detractors called him a <a id="Malingerer" href="gre-word-list.html#Malingerer">**malingerer**</a>, accusing him of avoiding responsibility. In response, he offered <a id="Admonitory" href="gre-word-list.html#Admonitory">**admonitory**</a> statements, attempting to shift blame while trying to <a id="Consecrate" href="gre-word-list.html#Consecrate">**consecrate**</a> his legacy. Despite his efforts to <a id="Tout" href="gre-word-list.html#Tout">**tout**</a> his achievements, the community remained skeptical, and the ultimate <a id="Denouement" href="gre-word-list.html#Denouement">**denouement**</a> of the situation was yet to unfold.

### Passage 04

The old town, once a vibrant hub, now looked <a id="Lugubrious" href="gre-word-list.html#Lugubrious">**lugubrious**</a>, with its <a id="Antiquated" href="gre-word-list.html#Antiquated">**antiquated**</a> buildings and fading architecture, leaving an impression of decay. It had reached its <a id="Zenith" href="gre-word-list.html#Zenith">**zenith**</a> decades ago, but now it seemed to <a id="Hobble" href="gre-word-list.html#Hobble">**hobble**</a> along, struggling with its old ways. The town's leaders, often seen to <a id="Badger" href="gre-word-list.html#Badger">**badger**</a> one another over petty issues, failed to <a id="Redress" href="gre-word-list.html#Redress">**redress**</a> the mounting challenges. Still, one or two had an uncanny <a id="Prescience" href="gre-word-list.html#Prescience">**prescience**</a> of the future and knew that change was inevitable. Their <a id="Scrupulous" href="gre-word-list.html#Scrupulous">**scrupulous**</a> attention to detail in preserving the town's best aspects stood in stark contrast to the others' apathy. In moments of conversation, a few of the more <a id="Urbane" href="gre-word-list.html#Urbane">**urbane**</a> residents spoke with a <a id="Nuance" href="gre-word-list.html#Nuance">**nuance**</a> that reflected an understanding of both the past and the future, trying to keep the town's spirit alive amidst the decline.

## Segment 03

### Passage 01

The discussion at the university symposium began as a casual <a id="Powwow" href="gre-word-list.html#Powwow">**powwow**</a>, but soon evolved into a spirited debate. An <a id="Erudite" href="gre-word-list.html#Erudite">**erudite**</a> professor of political philosophy presented a <a id="Tendentious" href="gre-word-list.html#Tendentious">**tendentious**</a> argument in favor of centralized governance, sparking strong reactions from the audience. His rhetoric was <a id="Artful" href="gre-word-list.html#Artful">**artful**</a>, weaving through <a id="Tortuous" href="gre-word-list.html#Tortuous">**tortuous**</a> lines of reasoning that required focused attention. A colleague attempted to <a id="Admonish" href="gre-word-list.html#Admonish">**admonish**</a> him gently, warning that such bias might alienate others. As the debate <a id="Culminate" href="gre-word-list.html#Culminate">**culminated**</a> in a round of open questions, a student stood up, her presence almost <a id="Ethereal" href="gre-word-list.html#Ethereal">**ethereal**</a> in her quiet confidence. She asked how, in a diverse society, one viewpoint could <a id="Prevail" href="gre-word-list.html#Prevail">**prevail**</a> without <a id="Disseminate" href="gre-word-list.html#Disseminate">**disseminating**</a> knowledge across perspectives. Her question drew applause, and the mood shifted to a more <a id="Genial" href="gre-word-list.html#Genial">**genial**</a> exchange of ideas.

### Passage 02

The general’s downfall was not due to a lack of strategy but rather his own <a id="Hubris" href="gre-word-list.html#Hubris">**hubris**</a>, which led him to ignore the warnings of his advisors. His speeches were often filled with <a id="Inanity" href="gre-word-list.html#Inanity">**inanity**</a>, lacking substance but delivered with unwarranted confidence. When the campaign failed, the press was quick to <a id="Upbraid" href="gre-word-list.html#Upbraid">**upbraid**</a> him for his arrogance. His staff, many of them <a id="Callow" href="gre-word-list.html#Callow">**callow**</a> recruits, had simply echoed his <a id="Dogmatic" href="gre-word-list.html#Dogmatic">**dogmatic**</a> views. Though a victory was eventually declared, it was a <a id="Pyrrhic" href="gre-word-list.html#Pyrrhic">**pyrrhic**</a> one—won at too great a cost. In trying to justify his decisions, he attempted to <a id="Beg" href="gre-word-list.html#Beg">**beg**</a> the question rather than provide evidence. Critics would later <a id="Extrapolate" href="gre-word-list.html#Extrapolate">**extrapolate**</a> from his mistakes the broader flaws in the military's leadership. Some reports even <a id="Implicate" href="gre-word-list.html#Implicate">**implicated**</a> senior officials in poor planning. Ultimately, the president had to <a id="Countermand" href="gre-word-list.html#Countermand">**countermand**</a> several directives to restore credibility.

### Passage 03

The explorer’s journal chronicled her <a id="Intrepid" href="gre-word-list.html#Intrepid">**intrepid**</a> journey through remote mountain ranges, where the terrain was harsh and the risks high. Despite the dangers, her spirit remained <a id="Ebullient" href="gre-word-list.html#Ebullient">**ebullient**</a>, inspiring her crew with her unwavering enthusiasm. Along the way, they encountered locals with <a id="Entrenched" href="gre-word-list.html#Entrenched">**entrenched**</a> traditions, resistant to outside influence. One rival expedition, led by an <a id="Imperious" href="gre-word-list.html#Imperious">**imperious**</a> and <a id="Insufferable" href="gre-word-list.html#Insufferable">**insufferable**</a> commander, created unnecessary <a id="Enmity" href="gre-word-list.html#Enmity">**enmity**</a> through their arrogance. Meanwhile, the slow and <a id="Plodding" href="gre-word-list.html#Plodding">**plodding**</a> pace of their travel was lightened by a guide whose voice was as <a id="Mellifluous" href="gre-word-list.html#Mellifluous">**mellifluous**</a> as it was informative. At a local market, she was amused by the <a id="Tawdry" href="gre-word-list.html#Tawdry">**tawdry**</a> souvenirs sold to tourists and scoffed at the <a id="Hackneyed" href="gre-word-list.html#Hackneyed">**hackneyed**</a> phrases painted on signs—proof that even in remote places, clichés abound.

### Passage 04

The once-quiet coastal town began to <a id="Burgeon" href="gre-word-list.html#Burgeon">**burgeon**</a> into a bustling port after the construction of a new harbor, a project designed to <a id="Buttress" href="gre-word-list.html#Buttress">**buttress**</a> the local economy. Despite the <a id="Robust" href="gre-word-list.html#Robust">**robust**</a> growth, not everyone welcomed the change. Longtime residents, some of whom grew <a id="Dolorous" href="gre-word-list.html#Dolorous">**dolorous**</a> at the loss of their peaceful routines, voiced their concerns at town meetings. The debates grew <a id="Tempestuous" href="gre-word-list.html#Tempestuous">**tempestuous**</a>, with opposing parties refusing to budge—especially one <a id="Adamant" href="gre-word-list.html#Adamant">**adamant**</a> council member who would not concede an inch. A few <a id="Frivolous" href="gre-word-list.html#Frivolous">**frivolous**</a> objections made by attention-seeking participants were quickly dismissed. But deeper issues remained, such as how to deal with an influx of outsiders, some of whom were <a id="Miscreant" href="gre-word-list.html#Miscreant">**miscreant**</a>s causing trouble. In hindsight, the town’s leaders had to <a id="Qualify" href="gre-word-list.html#Qualify">**qualify**</a> their initial optimism; the benefits, though tangible, came with <a id="Abysmal" href="gre-word-list.html#Abysmal">**abysmal**</a> consequences they hadn’t foreseen.

## Segment 04

### Passage 01

The migratory patterns of birds present a fascinating <a id="Conundrum" href="gre-word-list.html#Conundrum">**conundrum**</a> for ornithologists, who strive to understand the <a id="Concomitant" href="gre-word-list.html#Concomitant">**concomitant**</a> effects of climate change, habitat loss, and navigation instincts. While some species are <a id="Tractable" href="gre-word-list.html#Tractable">**tractable**</a> enough to be tracked and studied, others defy easy observation, frustrating even the most seasoned researchers. In their quest, scientists have shown immense <a id="Ingenuity" href="gre-word-list.html#Ingenuity">**ingenuity**</a>, using satellite tags and AI models. However, they often face opposition from those who <a id="Denigrate" href="gre-word-list.html#Denigrate">**denigrate**</a> conservation efforts as overly idealistic. When migration routes suddenly change, conservationists don’t <a id="Quail" href="gre-word-list.html#Quail">**quail**</a>; instead, they adapt with persistence. Despite occasional <a id="Rash" href="gre-word-list.html#Rash">**rash**</a> policy changes that disrupt bird habitats, the work of such researchers is <a id="Creditable" href="gre-word-list.html#Creditable">**creditable**</a> and often deserves a public <a id="Panegyric" href="gre-word-list.html#Panegyric">**panegyric**</a>. Still, delays in protection laws tend to <a id="Rile" href="gre-word-list.html#Rile">**rile**</a> both scientists and environmentalists alike.

### Passage 02

The construction of the Panama Canal was no simple engineering feat—it was a geopolitical <a id="Ploy" href="gre-word-list.html#Ploy">**ploy**</a> and technological marvel. Despite a <a id="Raft" href="gre-word-list.html#Raft">**raft**</a> of challenges, including disease and terrain, the project's success marked an <a id="Auspicious" href="gre-word-list.html#Auspicious">**auspicious**</a> turn for global trade. Engineers had to <a id="Contrive" href="gre-word-list.html#Contrive">**contrive**</a> innovative methods to manage elevation and water flow, and only a <a id="Stalwart" href="gre-word-list.html#Stalwart">**stalwart**</a> workforce could endure the demands. Still, political <a id="Discord" href="gre-word-list.html#Discord">**discord**</a> between nations loomed large. While some documents and structures from that time remain <a id="Extant" href="gre-word-list.html#Extant">**extant**</a>, the legacy is equally philosophical—pitting <a id="Intransigent" href="gre-word-list.html#Intransigent">**intransigent**</a> national interests against global cooperation. Even the most <a id="Saturnine" href="gre-word-list.html#Saturnine">**saturnine**</a> critics had to admit the project was a monumental success, though many sought to <a id="Check" href="gre-word-list.html#Check">**check**</a> American influence thereafter.

### Passage 03

The Solar System, a structured yet dynamic entity, has long captivated both scientists and <a id="Sybarite" href="gre-word-list.html#Sybarite">**sybarites**</a> alike—those who revel in cosmic beauty as much as luxury. The <a id="Moment" href="gre-word-list.html#Moment">**moment**</a> of its heliocentric realization was transformative in science. Yet, even in modern discourse, some hold <a id="Anachronism" href="gre-word-list.html#Anachronism">**anachronistic**</a> views, clinging to geocentric notions. Unlike the <a id="Placid" href="gre-word-list.html#Placid">**placid**</a> revolutions of Neptune, debates around Pluto’s planetary status continue to <a id="Goad" href="gre-word-list.html#Goad">**goad**</a> the scientific community. Some <a id="Harangue" href="gre-word-list.html#Harangue">**harangue**</a> NASA with fervor, demanding reclassification. It’s <a id="Impertinent" href="gre-word-list.html#Impertinent">**impertinent**</a> to dismiss these arguments, though many are <a id="Artless" href="gre-word-list.html#Artless">**artless**</a> in their logic. Theories often <a id="Subsume" href="gre-word-list.html#Subsume">**subsume**</a> smaller ideas into grand cosmological models, a process that can <a id="Cow" href="gre-word-list.html#Cow">**cow**</a> even experienced astronomers faced with the universe’s enormity.

### Passage 04

The culinary world, once in its <a id="Heyday" href="gre-word-list.html#Heyday">**heyday**</a> of traditional techniques and handwritten recipes, has transformed into a domain defined by innovation and spectacle. Yet, this evolution has not been without critique. Many chefs <a id="Castigate" href="gre-word-list.html#Castigate">**castigate**</a> the new generation for their <a id="Wanton" href="gre-word-list.html#Wanton">**wanton**</a> disregard for authenticity, accusing them of indulging in showmanship over substance. The rise of social media “foodies” has brought with it a <a id="Profuse" href="gre-word-list.html#Profuse">**profuse**</a> stream of content—much of it lacking depth—turning thoughtful culinary discourse into endless <a id="Palaver" href="gre-word-list.html#Palaver">**palaver**</a>. Meanwhile, critics lament the <a id="Turpitude" href="gre-word-list.html#Turpitude">**turpitude**</a> behind food waste and labor exploitation in high-end kitchens. Still, amid these <a id="Infelicitous" href="gre-word-list.html#Infelicitous">**infelicitous**</a> realities, a new <a id="Zeitgeist" href="gre-word-list.html#Zeitgeist">**zeitgeist**</a> has emerged—one that favors sustainability and inclusivity, seeking a return to a more <a id="Pristine" href="gre-word-list.html#Pristine">**pristine**</a> form of culinary art. However, some critics argue the shift has also ushered in <a id="Noisome" href="gre-word-list.html#Noisome">**noisome**</a> trends that prioritize viral appeal over gastronomic excellence.

## Segment 05

### Passage 01

Here is a short GRE-style passage with your requested words, formatted as per your instructions:

The professor’s lecture on the plague, replete with <a id="Macabre" href="gre-word-list.html#Macabre">**macabre**</a> anecdotes, struck some students as <a id="Indecorous" href="gre-word-list.html#Indecorous">**indecorous**</a> for a morning session. Yet, her intention was not to shock but to challenge the class's assumptions through <a id="Empiricism" href="gre-word-list.html#Empiricism">**empiricism**</a> rather than sanitized narratives. When a critic labeled her examples as “sensational,” she refused to <a id="Retract" href="gre-word-list.html#Retract">**retract**</a> her approach, insisting it was a <a id="Deliberate" href="gre-word-list.html#Deliberate">**deliberate**</a> pedagogical choice. Others, more <a id="Obliging" href="gre-word-list.html#Obliging">**obliging**</a> to convention, avoided controversial topics altogether, fearing departmental <a id="Excoriate" href="gre-word-list.html#Excoriate">**excoriate**</a>ion. Still, she argued that avoiding discomfort allows minds to <a id="Ossify" href="gre-word-list.html#Ossify">**ossify**</a>, making growth <a id="Elude" href="gre-word-list.html#Elude">**elude**</a> both student and teacher. Petty objections about tone seemed <a id="Picayune" href="gre-word-list.html#Picayune">**picayune**</a> in comparison to the intellectual rigor she demanded.

### Passage 02

Despite the <a id="Vicissitude" href="gre-word-list.html#Vicissitude">**vicissitudes**</a> of economic downturns and leadership changes, Maya remained a <a id="Tenacious" href="gre-word-list.html#Tenacious">**tenacious**</a> advocate for transparency in public office. She refused the subtle <a id="Perquisite" href="gre-word-list.html#Perquisite">**perquisites**</a> offered by lobbyists, aware that such privileges often <a id="Denote" href="gre-word-list.html#Denote">**denote**</a> deeper currents of <a id="Venality" href="gre-word-list.html#Venality">**venality**</a>. Her critics labeled her <a id="Sanctimonious" href="gre-word-list.html#Sanctimonious">**sanctimonious**</a>, scoffing at her moral rigor, while supporters viewed her as a rare <a id="Percipient" href="gre-word-list.html#Percipient">**percipient**</a> voice amid the noise. Unlike her more <a id="Pollyannaish" href="gre-word-list.html#Pollyannaish">**Pollyannaish**</a> peers, she did not downplay the system’s flaws, nor did she lack the <a id="Gall" href="gre-word-list.html#Gall">**gall**</a> to challenge entrenched powers. Her stance, though not always popular, had become a <a id="Perennial" href="gre-word-list.html#Perennial">**perennial**</a> thorn in the side of corruption.

### The Fall of the Model Officer

Once a <a id="Paragon" href="gre-word-list.html#Paragon">**paragon**</a> of discipline and integrity, Lieutenant Harrow had grown increasingly <a id="Besotted" href="gre-word-list.html#Besotted">**besotted**</a> with the charms of a foreign dignitary’s daughter. His once-<a id="Candid" href="gre-word-list.html#Candid">**candid**</a> assessments were now clouded by loyalty to her father’s <a id="Treacherous" href="gre-word-list.html#Treacherous">**treacherous**</a> plans. Harrow had always been <a id="Amenable" href="gre-word-list.html#Amenable">**amenable**</a> to advice, but this time he allowed her to <a id="Ingratiate" href="gre-word-list.html#Ingratiate">**ingratiate**</a> herself so completely that he <a id="Cede" href="gre-word-list.html#Cede">**ceded**</a> control of classified protocols. His superiors, <a id="Splenetic" href="gre-word-list.html#Splenetic">**splenetic**</a> and stunned, assigned an agent to <a id="Ferret" href="gre-word-list.html#Ferret">**ferret**</a> out the source of the leaks. Harrow, under investigation, found a brief <a id="Respite" href="gre-word-list.html#Respite">**respite**</a> only in recalling the days before he’d let love cloud duty.

### Shadows Beneath the Surface

The committee meeting began with a stern warning from the chair, who had vowed to <a id="Censor" href="gre-word-list.html#Censor">**censor**</a> any <a id="Facetious" href="gre-word-list.html#Facetious">**facetious**</a> remarks during the review of wartime broadcasts. But despite the grave atmosphere, one member’s tone remained <a id="Surly" href="gre-word-list.html#Surly">**surly**</a>, his contributions laced with contempt. When asked for a clear position, he became <a id="Evasive" href="gre-word-list.html#Evasive">**evasive**</a>, dodging accountability with rhetorical flourish. A <a id="Recapitulation" href="gre-word-list.html#Recapitulation">**recapitulation**</a> of events was requested, and a <a id="Scrupulous" href="gre-word-list.html#Scrupulous">**scrupulous**</a> secretary read from detailed minutes. Meanwhile, a junior assistant, anxious to <a id="Grovel" href="gre-word-list.html#Grovel">**grovel**</a> before superiors, insisted even the most <a id="Innocuous" href="gre-word-list.html#Innocuous">**innocuous**</a> jokes had damaging potential. It was, many agreed, a <a id="Benighted" href="gre-word-list.html#Benighted">**benighted**</a> hour for open discourse. In the end, the board’s final <a id="Word" href="gre-word-list.html#Word">**word**</a> was that humor, like history, must sometimes yield to policy.
