## Day 01

### Set 01

The speaker’s attempt to <a id="Embellish" href="gre-word-list.html#Embellish">**embellish**</a> the facts only served to confuse the audience, as he began to <a id="Meander" href="gre-word-list.html#Meander">**meander**</a> through irrelevant anecdotes. In contrast, his opponent’s argument was both <a id="Cerebral" href="gre-word-list.html#Cerebral">**cerebral**</a> and <a id="Cogent" href="gre-word-list.html#Cogent">**cogent**</a>, supported by data and a clear logical structure. The most compelling <a id="Corollary" href="gre-word-list.html#Corollary">**corollary**</a> to her reasoning was that effective policies must remain <a id="Steadfast" href="gre-word-list.html#Steadfast">**steadfast**</a> even in the face of political turbulence. Her <a id="Dispassionate" href="gre-word-list.html#Dispassionate">**dispassionate**</a> tone contrasted sharply with his tendency to <a id="Belittle" href="gre-word-list.html#Belittle">**belittle**</a> opposing views. In a move to <a id="Preempt" href="gre-word-list.html#Preempt">**preempt**</a> criticism, she addressed the weaknesses in her proposal openly, avoiding the kind of <a id="Duplicity" href="gre-word-list.html#Duplicity">**duplicity**</a> that had undermined earlier debates.

### Set 02

The museum’s new exhibit, curated by a renowned <a id="Aesthete" href="gre-word-list.html#Aesthete">**aesthete**</a>, was a <a id="Cohesive" href="gre-word-list.html#Cohesive">**cohesive**</a> blend of classical elegance and modern flair. While most attendees were <a id="Genteel" href="gre-word-list.html#Genteel">**genteel**</a> in their praise, one critic offered a <a id="Sardonic" href="gre-word-list.html#Sardonic">**sardonic**</a> take, calling the fusion “a tasteful train wreck.” Reactions were largely <a id="Contingent" href="gre-word-list.html#Contingent">**contingent**</a> on personal taste, but the artist, known for her <a id="Whimsical" href="gre-word-list.html#Whimsical">**whimsical**</a> style, remained unfazed. The choice to feature an <a id="Anomalous" href="gre-word-list.html#Anomalous">**anomalous**</a> piece—a digital sculpture made entirely of sound—was seen by some as an <a id="Aberration" href="gre-word-list.html#Aberration">**aberration**</a>. Yet, for others, it captured the very <a id="Imponderable" href="gre-word-list.html#Imponderable">**imponderable**</a> nature of art itself.


### Set 03

As the storm grew more <a id="Inclement" href="gre-word-list.html#Inclement">**inclement**</a>, officials moved quickly to <a id="Avert" href="gre-word-list.html#Avert">**avert**</a> disaster by evacuating the area. The mayor, usually <a id="Expansive" href="gre-word-list.html#Expansive">**expansive**</a> in demeanor, grew solemn, eventually forced to <a id="Concede" href="gre-word-list.html#Concede">**concede**</a> that their preparations had fallen short. Citizens, <a id="Bereft" href="gre-word-list.html#Bereft">**bereft**</a> of shelter and supplies, began to <a id="Besiege" href="gre-word-list.html#Besiege">**besiege**</a> local aid centers. Critics did not hesitate to <a id="Censure" href="gre-word-list.html#Censure">**censure**</a> the administration for the glaring <a id="Inequity" href="gre-word-list.html#Inequity">**inequity**</a> in resource distribution. News outlets sought to <a id="Delineate" href="gre-word-list.html#Delineate">**delineate**</a> the chain of failures that had led to this crisis, particularly the neglect of vulnerable neighborhoods—areas many accused the government of having <a id="Desecrate" href="gre-word-list.html#Desecrate">**desecrated**</a> through years of policy indifference.

### Set 04

His career had finally reached its <a id="Summit" href="gre-word-list.html#Summit">**summit**</a>, a pinnacle of achievement few in his field could rival. But success did not make him complacent. While others might indulge, he maintained a <a id="Spartan" href="gre-word-list.html#Spartan">**spartan**</a> lifestyle, eschewing luxury for discipline. A sudden scandal emerged, yet he remained untouched, his character long considered <a id="Unimpeachable" href="gre-word-list.html#Unimpeachable">**unimpeachable**</a>. In the face of public frenzy, where commentators <a id="Maunder" href="gre-word-list.html#Maunder">**maundered**</a> endlessly with little substance, he took quiet but firm action. Though the crisis was an <a id="Anomaly" href="gre-word-list.html#Anomaly">**anomaly**</a> in an otherwise smooth trajectory, his <a id="Resolve" href="gre-word-list.html#Resolve">**resolve**</a> never faltered. He worked to <a id="Foment" href="gre-word-list.html#Foment">**foment**</a> meaningful change rather than retaliation, an <a id="Estimable" href="gre-word-list.html#Estimable">**estimable**</a> quality that drew admiration—even from opponents. In contrast, his rival’s <a id="Forlorn" href="gre-word-list.html#Forlorn">**forlorn**</a> efforts to stir a <a id="Melee" href="gre-word-list.html#Melee">**melee**</a> of public opinion quickly fizzled, lacking the gravity or grace to match him.

## Day 02

### Set 01

She tried to <a id="Equivocate" href="gre-word-list.html#Equivocate">**equivocate**</a> during the interview, dodging questions about her controversial report, but the panel wasn’t fooled. The once <a id="Effervescent" href="gre-word-list.html#Effervescent">**effervescent**</a> scientist now appeared <a id="Morose" href="gre-word-list.html#Morose">**morose**</a>, her energy drained by months of criticism. The backlash had been <a id="Excruciating" href="gre-word-list.html#Excruciating">**excruciating**</a>, amplified by the media’s relentless desire to <a id="Pillory" href="gre-word-list.html#Pillory">**pillory**</a> anyone who defied consensus. Attempts to <a id="Squelch" href="gre-word-list.html#Squelch">**squelch**</a> the uproar had failed, and even her supporters grew <a id="Disheartened" href="gre-word-list.html#Disheartened">**disheartened**</a>. What was most <a id="Poignant" href="gre-word-list.html#Poignant">**poignant**</a> was the contrast between her current state and her past brilliance—when she made <a id="Prodigious" href="gre-word-list.html#Prodigious">**prodigious**</a> discoveries and carried herself with inspiring confidence. But over time, her once-bold stance softened into a <a id="Complacent" href="gre-word-list.html#Complacent">**complacent**</a> silence, worn down by a system that punished dissent.

### Set 02

Launched in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope marked a revolutionary shift in astronomy, offering a level of detail previously thought unattainable. Despite initial setbacks—including an <a id="Anemic" href="gre-word-list.html#Anemic">**anemic**</a> start due to a flawed mirror—subsequent repairs transformed it into one of science’s most <a id="Estimable" href="gre-word-list.html#Estimable">**estimable**</a> tools. The <a id="Fete" href="gre-word-list.html#Fete">**fete**</a> surrounding its discoveries was well-deserved, from capturing distant galaxies to providing data that challenged cosmic expansion theories. Though occasionally <a id="Disheartened" href="gre-word-list.html#Disheartened">**disheartened**</a> by delays and budget cuts, the scientific community remained steadfast, recognizing that even minor discoveries could <a id="Recrudesce" href="gre-word-list.html#Recrudesce">**recrudesce**</a> dormant questions about our universe’s origins.

### Set 03

In the field of geography, a <a id="Tyro" href="gre-word-list.html#Tyro">**tyro**</a> may initially struggle with the complexities of spatial data and climate modeling, often overwhelmed by the depth of knowledge required. However, with time and guidance, even the most <a id="Inarticulate" href="gre-word-list.html#Inarticulate">**inarticulate**</a> students can develop the necessary skills, becoming more <a id="Savvy" href="gre-word-list.html#Savvy">**savvy**</a> in interpreting maps and understanding ecological patterns. A <a id="Rapprochement" href="gre-word-list.html#Rapprochement">**rapprochement**</a> between theory and practice is often seen as students <a id="Dovetail" href="gre-word-list.html#Dovetail">**dovetail**</a> their learning experiences with real-world applications. Though early lessons can sometimes feel <a id="Soporific" href="gre-word-list.html#Soporific">**soporific**</a>, the <a id="Candidness" href="gre-word-list.html#Candidness">**candidness**</a> of the instruction often makes students appreciate the importance of foundational knowledge, helping them avoid a <a id="Jejune" href="gre-word-list.html#Jejune">**jejune**</a> understanding of the subject. It's not uncommon for a <a id="Flippant" href="gre-word-list.html#Flippant">**flippant**</a> attitude to emerge among beginners, but with time, this is replaced by more <a id="Approbatory" href="gre-word-list.html#Approbatory">**approbatory**</a> recognition of the discipline's significance.

### Set 04

The Eiffel Tower, an iconic structure in Paris, is a <a id="Conspicuous" href="gre-word-list.html#Conspicuous">**conspicuous**</a> symbol of French ingenuity and engineering prowess, towering over the city. However, its original reception was less than <a id="Amiable" href="gre-word-list.html#Amiable">**amiable**</a>, with many critics <a id="Confound" href="gre-word-list.html#Confound">**confounding**</a> its design with disdain, calling it an eyesore. Despite these critiques, the tower has become so synonymous with Paris that it’s nearly impossible to <a id="Differentiate" href="gre-word-list.html#Differentiate">**differentiate**</a> the city from the monument itself. In its early years, some even considered the structure an <a id="Apostate" href="gre-word-list.html#Apostate">**apostate**</a> against traditional French architecture, marking a departure from classical styles. Yet, through the years, it has emerged as a <a id="Sedulous" href="gre-word-list.html#Sedulous">**sedulous**</a> testament to progress, overcoming early disparagements. Like a <a id="Hound" href="gre-word-list.html#Hound">**hound**</a> relentlessly pursuing its goal, the Eiffel Tower rose to prominence, its critics unable to <a id="Arrogate" href="gre-word-list.html#Arrogate">**arrogate**</a> its position as a cultural landmark. Today, it stands as a symbol of both <a id="Martial" href="gre-word-list.html#Martial">**martial**</a> precision and artistic elegance, despite being built during an era when many regarded it as an <a id="Errant" href="gre-word-list.html#Errant">**arrant**</a> folly. Yet, its towering presence is anything but <a id="Phlegmatic" href="gre-word-list.html#Phlegmatic">**phlegmatic**</a>, as it continues to inspire awe in visitors from around the world.

## Day 03

### Set 03

The Amazon Rainforest, often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth," is a vast and diverse ecosystem that spans across nine countries in South America. Its ecological importance is <a id="Impregnable" href="gre-word-list.html#Impregnable">**impregnable**</a>, playing a crucial role in regulating the global climate by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide. However, human activity, such as deforestation, continues to <a id="Exasperate" href="gre-word-list.html#Exasperate">**exasperate**</a> conservation efforts, as the forest’s delicate balance is being disrupted. To <a id="Disabuse" href="gre-word-list.html#Disabuse">**disabuse**</a> those who think that the Amazon is invulnerable, it is important to note that its survival is increasingly under threat. While some <a id="Espouse" href="gre-word-list.html#Espouse">**espouse**</a> the idea of economic development over environmental concerns, many environmentalists argue that the future of the Earth hinges on preserving this irreplaceable resource. The Amazon also has a <a id="Forthcoming" href="gre-word-list.html#Forthcoming">**forthcoming**</a> role in scientific discoveries, with ongoing research revealing new species and medicinal plants. Despite challenges, the Amazon remains a <a id="Thoroughgoing" href="gre-word-list.html#Thoroughgoing">**thoroughgoing**</a> testament to the Earth’s natural beauty and resilience, and efforts to protect it have been gaining momentum globally. The region's indigenous peoples, although <a id="Diffident" href="gre-word-list.html#Diffident">**diffident**</a> about outsiders, have long been protectors of the forest, offering valuable knowledge on sustainable living. As the world faces environmental crises, the Amazon serves as a <a id="Audacious" href="gre-word-list.html#Audacious">**audacious**</a> reminder of nature's grandeur and fragility. The devastation of parts of the forest would <a id="Stultify" href="gre-word-list.html#Stultify">**stultify**</a> any efforts to combat climate change. The increasing power of multinational corporations, sometimes acting as a <a id="Junta" href="gre-word-list.html#Junta">**junta**</a> in their impact on the region, poses a serious threat to the rainforest's survival. Preserving the Amazon is nothing short of an <a id="Apotheosis" href="gre-word-list.html#Apotheosis">**apotheosis**</a> of global environmental efforts.

### Set 02

The journey of exploring new cultures can often be filled with both joy and <a id="Tribulation" href="gre-word-list.html#Tribulation">**tribulation**</a>. While the rewards of travel can be immense, travelers must also <a id="Abrogate" href="gre-word-list.html#Abrogate">**abrogate**</a> some of their preconceived notions and habits. In certain parts of the world, people may have a <a id="Rakish" href="gre-word-list.html#Rakish">**rakish**</a> appearance, with a confident air that might come off as <a id="Hauteur" href="gre-word-list.html#Hauteur">**hauteur**</a> to those unfamiliar with the culture. Still, if one can <a id="Dispatch" href="gre-word-list.html#Dispatch">**dispatch**</a> any fears quickly, the experience will be enriching. However, <a id="Hamper" href="gre-word-list.html#Hamper">**hamper**</a>ing circumstances such as language barriers or unfamiliar environments can sometimes make the journey <a id="Languid" href="gre-word-list.html#Languid">**languid**</a> and tiresome. Still, the effort is often worth it. As one becomes more accustomed, they might <a id="Bristle" href="gre-word-list.html#Bristle">**bristle**</a> at the notion of having to revert to their old, comfortable ways. Some interactions, however, can have <a id="Invidious" href="gre-word-list.html#Invidious">**invidious**</a> qualities, with undercurrents of jealousy or competition. Fortunately, many people remain <a id="Guileless" href="gre-word-list.html#Guileless">**guileless**</a>, welcoming others with genuine warmth. The <a id="Intimate" href="gre-word-list.html#Intimate">**intimate**</a> connections forged in such environments often begin with subtle <a id="Intimation" href="gre-word-list.html#Intimation">**intimations**</a> of shared understanding.

### Set 03

In the small town, the <a id="Demean" href="gre-word-list.html#Demean">**demean**</a>ing behavior of the local leader became a topic of much <a id="Reproach" href="gre-word-list.html#Reproach">**reproach**</a>, as many felt that he had fallen from the <a id="Pinnacle" href="gre-word-list.html#Pinnacle">**pinnacle**</a> of integrity. His actions seemed to <a id="Galvanize" href="gre-word-list.html#Galvanize">**galvanize**</a> the community, pushing them to take action and demand change. A once <a id="Derelict" href="gre-word-list.html#Derelict">**derelict**</a> and uninvolved group of citizens were now full of energy and purpose, though they were also <a id="Unnerve" href="gre-word-list.html#Unnerve">**unnerve**</a>d by the unrest that had taken root. Some detractors called him a <a id="Malingerer" href="gre-word-list.html#Malingerer">**malingerer**</a>, accusing him of avoiding responsibility. In response, he offered <a id="Admonitory" href="gre-word-list.html#Admonitory">**admonitory**</a> statements, attempting to shift blame while trying to <a id="Consecrate" href="gre-word-list.html#Consecrate">**consecrate**</a> his legacy. Despite his efforts to <a id="Tout" href="gre-word-list.html#Tout">**tout**</a> his achievements, the community remained skeptical, and the ultimate <a id="Denouement" href="gre-word-list.html#Denouement">**denouement**</a> of the situation was yet to unfold.

### Set 04

The small coastal village, once bustling with tourists, had now become <a id="Lugubrious" href="gre-word-list.html#Lugubrious">**lugubrious**</a> in its silence. The residents, their faces drawn with worry, seemed like ghosts of their former selves, weighed down by the struggle to maintain their livelihoods. Despite the <a id="Antiquated" href="gre-word-list.html#Antiquated">**antiquated**</a> fishing boats that still lined the shore, the younger generation had long since left, seeking more promising opportunities in larger cities. The sea, once the heart of their community, had become an <a id="Exiguity" href="gre-word-list.html#Exiguity">**exiguity**</a> of hope, offering only a meager living. Yet, there was still a small, but <a id="Sedulous" href="gre-word-list.html#Sedulous">**sedulous**</a> group of fishermen who persisted, though they were constantly hampered by the <a id="Inclement" href="gre-word-list.html#Inclement">**inclement**</a> weather. Their hope for a better future was a rare, flickering light amidst the town's desolation. Despite the <a id="Diminutive" href="gre-word-list.html#Diminutive">**diminutive**</a> population left, the town's few residents still held on to a sense of community, struggling to make sense of their dwindling fortunes.
