### Set 01

**Passage: The Enduring Mystery of the Indus Valley Civilization**

The Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, flourished in the basins of the Indus River and the Ghaggar-Hakra River (identified with the Sarasvati River) in what is now Pakistan and northwest India from around 3300 to 1900 BCE. It was one of the three early civilizations of the Near East and South Asia, along with Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt. At its peak, the Indus Civilization may have had a population of over five million people.

One of the most remarkable aspects of this civilization was its sophisticated urban planning. The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, among others, featured well-laid-out grid systems, standardized baked brick construction, advanced drainage and sanitation systems, and impressive public structures like granaries and the Great Bath. This level of urban organization suggests a highly developed central authority and a meticulous understanding of engineering and urban design.

Despite the extensive archaeological evidence, including numerous seals, pottery, jewelry, and figurines, the Indus script remains undeciphered. This lack of a Rosetta Stone has hindered our understanding of their language, social structure, religious beliefs, and political organization. While various theories have been proposed, ranging from Indo-Aryan to Dravidian origins, none have gained widespread acceptance among scholars.

The decline of the Indus Valley Civilization around 1900 BCE is another area of ongoing debate. Several factors are believed to have contributed to its demise, including climate change (such as prolonged droughts or shifts in river courses), environmental degradation, overpopulation, and potential invasions by Indo-Aryan speaking peoples. However, the precise interplay of these factors and the exact nature of the civilization's collapse remain subjects of scholarly inquiry.

Recent archaeological findings continue to shed new light on the Indus Civilization, revealing a wider geographical spread than previously thought and suggesting a more complex and interconnected society. The ongoing research and the persistent mystery of the undeciphered script ensure that the Indus Valley Civilization will remain a captivating subject of study for years to come, offering valuable insights into the ingenuity and the eventual vulnerabilities of early urban societies.
